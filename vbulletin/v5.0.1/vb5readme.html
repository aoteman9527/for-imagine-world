        <h2><a name="new"></a>What's new in vBulletin 5 Connect</h2>
        <p>vBulletin 5 has been designed to bring you modern community building and ease of use.</p>
        <p><b>Site Builder</b> - One of the best new features of vBulletin 5 Connect is Site Builder. Site Builder is a new way to build and manage your sites. It features drag and drop technology to enable you to build custom pages that fit your needs quickly and easily. Site Builder also includes a Style Generator so you can quickly and easily create a new styles with custom color combinations. </p>
        <p><b>Everything is Content</b> - In vBulletin 5, we've developed an idea that everything is content. This is built around a new content model involving channels, nodes and the actual content. In this model everything works the same, everything is searchable and everything provides a modern input system. Adding new content should be more intuitive for your users.</p>
        <p><b>New Search</b> - The Search Engine architecture has also been reconfigured so that all content is easily searched. Rewritten from the ground up, the new search engine should provide more relevant details and accurate results.</p>
        <p><b>MVC Architecture</b> - vBulletin 5 Connect introduces a new MVC Architecture designed to separate the business logic from the presentation logic more than ever before. This will allow vBulletin 5 to be quickly and easily extended as we bring new features to the software.  </p>
        <p><b>Responsive Design</b> - People are using devices of many different sizes these days. These include phones, tablets and ultra-high density monitors. We've included a responsive design in vBulletin 5 that scales to the device being used. No more worrying about mobile styles and trying to configure things for multiple devices. vBulletin adjusts to the screen-size of the user's device automatically. </p>
        <p><b>Expanded API</b> - The API of vBulletin has been expanded. Not only can mobile apps take advantage of the API, the web interface of vBulletin uses it for its own purposes as well. This provides a more structured design and the ability to code everything once regardless of how it is accessed. </p>

            <li>Copy the /upload/ your new html folder. For simplicity's sake, I'm going to assumed it's been renamed and refer to it as /vb5/.</li>
            <li>Rename /vb5/core/includes/config.php.new to config.php and edit it like you would for vB4. (Change the database credentials & database name.). This is similar to how you installed/upgraded vBulletin 3 and 4.</li>

        <h2><a name="upgrade"></a>Upgrading to vBulletin 5 Connect</h2>
            <p class="warning">Please note that vBulletin 5 has two config.php files. It is very important that both are edited and the values of any overlapping variables like cookie prefix are identical in both files.</p>
            <h3><a name="upgrade.1"></a>Before You Upgrade</h3>
            <p>Upgrading any major software platform should be carefully thought through beforehand; for many of you, vBulletin is the heart of your site. Here are some things to consider when upgrading:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Do you rely heavily on the Calendar feature? If so, these will not be included in vBulletin 5 at initial launch but are planned to be added soon after. If you rely on these areas of functionality then don't upgrade at this time - unless you're happy that these will not be available to you and your users in the short term.</li>
                <li><b>UPGRADES FROM vB4 ONLY</b> The vBulletin CMS will not feature in vBulletin 5 until a future vBulletin 5 Connect version is released. If you rely on the CMS on your site then you should hold off until 5.1 is released and upgrade at that time.</li>
                <li>Have you installed any plugins or products? If so, the first thing you'll need to decide is - "Is this critical to my site?" If the answer is yes, you will first need to check that a vB5 compatible version of the modification is available, either at www.vbulletin.org or via the author's own site. If the answer is no, then you need take no action as vBulletin 5's new API system means that any existing plugins and products won't work - however after you upgrade, it would be good practice to make sure you remove any files required by these.</li>
                <li>vBulletin 5's template code has been rewritten from scratch so existing themes/styles from vB4 will not work with it. As with plugins and products, if you're looking to retain a similar look and feel to your site or simply don't wish to use the default style after upgrading, you will need to do one of three things:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact the style designer to see if they've already created a vB5 compatible version of the style</li>
                        <li>Download and install a new vB5 compatible style from www.vbulletin.org or another supplier or</li>
                        <li>Create a test installation of vB5 and create your own unique style from scratch</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Are you running a big board? We know that upgrading a big board can be complicated and has its own set of issues. Please refer to our installation best practice guides in the vBulletin Blogs which will be updated with the latest information to help you upgrade your site smoothly.</li>
                <li>Do you use a custom .htaccess file on your site? As vBulletin 5 comes with URL Rewrites as standard, it includes an .htaccess by default. Uploading the files for the upgrade will see your custom .htaccess file overwritten losing any custom code that you had within the file (URL Rewrites, specific filetype caching). Make sure you have a backup of your .htaccess file before proceeding with the upgrade then you can look to merge the contents of your custom file and the vBulletin 5 default file after upgrading.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3><a name="upgrade.2"></a>After downloading vBulletin 5 Connect from the your Member's Area.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Unzip the package</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Rename /vb5/config.php.bkp to config.php.</li>
                <li>Set the baseurl to the url of the vb5 directory. For example, http://www.example.com/vb5</li>
                <li>You can ignore all other values for a basic setup.</li>

            <h3><a name="upgrade.4"></a>Running the Upgrade Wizard</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Go to the install directory of core in your browser to install vB5. This is just like installing vB4. Ex: http://www.example.com/vb5/core/install/upgrade.php</li>

            </ul>
            <h3><a name="upgrade.5"></a>Command Line Upgrades.</h3>
            <p>If you have a larger forum, you should upgrade via the command line. This is a faster and more efficient way to upgrade. In order to do this, follow these steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Edit your config.php files as stated above.</li>
                <li>Connect to your server via SSH.</li>
                <li>Switch to your forum's core install directory. example: cd <install location>/core/install</li>
                <li>Type this command: php upgrade.php</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can use this command "nohup php upgrade.php &" if you feel that your SSH connection will fail in the middle of the upgrade. This will allow the upgrade to continue in the background without a connection.</p>

        <h2><a name="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p>Below are some of the frequently asked questions about this version of vBulletin.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Why are there two config.php files?</dt>
            <dd>vBulletin 5 has two layers of functionality. These are the Presentation and the Core Layers. The Presentation layer does not have permission to use code in the Core layer directly and accesses it via the API. This allows more data security and in the future can include the functionality where the Core layer is located on a completely different server for more security.</dd>
            <dt>None of my vBulletin 3 or 4 Addons work.</dt>
            <dd>These are not supported in vBulletin 5.</dd>
            <dt>None of my vBulletin 3 or 4 Styles work.</dt>
            <dd>These are not supported in vBulletin 5.</dd>

            <dd>The short answer is that you cannot do this. However you can set permissions so that end users cannot see these features. Please open a forum thread for assistance in doing this.</dd>
            <dt>How do I remove the Activity Stream?</dt>
            <dd>You can't however you can disable the specific tab, rearrange the tabs and change the default tab. Please see the support forums for assistance.</dd>

        <p>vBulletin includes a Language Manager in the admin control panel. This allows you to translate the vBulletin interface into your own language or several languages, as well as being able to import language packs created others. Your users can then select the language they prefer to view the board in. We do have a Languages & Phrases forum where you can find packs donated by our customers and also receive help for creating your own: <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=87">http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=87</a>*</p>
        <p>Also, here's the forum containing downloads of the current Language Packs made available by our customers: <b>http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=96</b>*</p>
        <p>Please note, the Language Management System only covers the board text and not individual posts.  The posts themselves will be displayed in the original language they were written in.</p>
